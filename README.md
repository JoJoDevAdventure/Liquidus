# Liquidus

This iOS app lets you log the liquids you drink and see the breakup of what you're consuming. It requires no external libraries or APIs to function.

This is apart of the CodeWithChris Monthly App Challenge for September 2021.

If you want to see a more in-depth view into the development of this app, you can check out my journal:

This app will most likely never be released publicly on the App Store and is really to just challenge myself.
